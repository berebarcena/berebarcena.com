                    <p>I am a design professional interested in several areas of design. Working as an Industrial designer I've had the opportunity to create tangible products from scratch and interact with customers to accomplish a good result.
                    Lately I've been very interested in user experience design and I'm constantly looking for new challenges in this field to expand my skill set as a designer.</p>

                   <p>I'm practical, observant, curious and realistic; passionate about classical music and beautiful interfaces. I can draw (both analog and digital), code websites (still learning js) and play violin and piano. </p>

                            <p>“Farmacias Benavides” is one of the biggest pharmacy shops in Mexico that sells a wide variety of products.

Our task consisted in building an app for tablets which allowed managers for each of their stores to analyze and make a summary of their different productivity indicators. This would help them make easier and faster decisions and have a better control over their management.

The project had a very high priority and we had a timeframe of 6 weeks to design and build the app.
I was in charge of all the user experience, which also involved several meetings with the client.
</p>                        
                            
                            <h3>The challenge</h3>
                            <p>Being one of my first projects as part of the Censere team, I wasn’t very sure of where to start. 

The first thing I did was research different dashboards trying to accomplish a   similar goal, to get a better understanding of how to organize all the  information.
</p>

                            <p>
Given the time restriction we had, the Project Manager decided to use a  frontend framework for the user interface</p>

                            <p>I hand drew several sketches to explore different ways of organizing the data. This helped me do quick iterations with the team while validating and discarding several ideas.</p>

                            <p>Once we defined the structure, I used Axure to build a prototype, allowing us to show the client our ideas and our planned flow for the app. </p>
                            <h3>the results</h3>
                            <p>The app allows managers to view all the information about their store and generate reports. They see a summarized quick view of the information and have options to extend it and see it in better detail. Red numbers represent negative data, helping the managers recognize places where things can be improved.</p>

                            <h3>lessons learned</h3>
                            <p>Being one of my very first projects as a UX designer, I was forced to grow and learn new skills. The number of restrictions were big, with such a short timeframe and a small team so this put me in a challenging position having to work quick and take  different roles at the same time. <br>

One of the  biggest lessons was about interacting with the client and fully 
 understanding requirements for them to be properly translated into usable designs.

                            <h3>Project Background</h3>
                            <p>Andrea is a company dedicated to selling shoes through catalogues across Mexico. They currently have an online presence, but it’s limited to sales people for them to get inventory online.
                            Our job was to create a site with a brand new look and feel and responsive features, while sticking to their strict design guidelines. The project’s timeline was broken down into different phases and the first phase consisted of 10 months.</p>
                            <p>I was in charge of UX design as well as implementing parts of the front end. We had to work very closely with Andrea’s Marcom team as well as their own developers.</p>

                            <h3>The challenge</h3>
                            <p>The site has 3 different kinds of users, each one with access to different kinds of information and different features across the site. Another big challenge was that the end users for the site had little to no level of experience using the web. This meant that the designed needed to be extremely obvious to navigate through.</p>
                            <h3>The work</h3>
                            <p>I started by elaborating flow charts for the different kinds of users. This would help define what kind of information was needed for each and how to display it.</p>

                            <p class="small center">WIREFRAMES AND PROTOTYPE</p>
                            <p>We created low res wireframes in Balsamiq to get some feedback and better understand the client’s requirements, as we were working remotely with them and having a visual representation made it easier to transmit ideas.</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/andrea/andrea-wireframes.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>After this, I built a fully functional prototype using Axure. This prototype showed every single one of the pages the real store was to consist of. This was extremely helpful as the company executives could use it to verify that all requirements and objectives were to be achieved by the site. This prototype also included 
several notes describing the intentional user behavior for every feature.</p>

                            <p class="small center">EARLY MOCKS</p>
                            <p>After several months of meetings, we got an approved prototype and started implementing it into the Magento store.
We did a few design exercises in order to find the right visual style. </p>

                            <h3>The results</h3>
                            <p>In the end we built a fresh looking site keeping some features the client was not willing to let go. 
Unfortunately as an agency our research results and expertise in UX were not enough to convince the client to get rid of these features but we were able to make several changes to the sitemap and user flow to make it a lot easier for end users to reach their goal.</p>

                            <p>The big thing I learned from this project was how to work with a client that wanted to rebrand their site but was reluctant to change. This meant having to find the sweet spot between a happy client and the best user experience possible</p>

                            <h3>Project Background</h3>
                            <p>“Farmacias del Ahorro” is a popular pharmaceutical shop in Mexico. Just like “Farmacias Benavides”, they sell a wide variety of products.
Our job was to make a redesign of their online store while maintaining their corporate identity. Our timeframe for the project was of about 8 weeks and the main objective was to get more people to register to the site.<br>

I was in charge of the UX design and the frontend implementation.</p>
                            <h3>the work</h3>
                            <p>I started by analyzing the site’s usability weaknesses and found that one of the main problems was the 
overall registration process. The form was too long and complex, making it hard to digest even in a desktop  </p>
                            <p class="it small center">Irrelevant information</p>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ahorro/ahorro_1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

                            <img src="img/portfolio/ahorro/ahorro_2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <P>I hand drew several sketches which helped me decide on a better way of organizing the information making sure it would be easier to digest. After a few iterations, I mocked it on Fireworks for the client to review and sign off.</P>
                            <img src="img/portfolio/ahorro/ahorro_good.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <p>We used an iterative process across all the redesigned areas through which every design was prototyped and signed off by the client. </p>
                            <h3>THE RESULTS</h3>
                            <p>The changes resulted in a 40% increase in registered users during the first 2 weeks as well as an increased overall traffic across the site.</p>

                            <h3>Lessons learned</h3>
                            <p>This project was a very challenging one because it didn’t only required me to use my existing knowledge but also to learn several different things. I was forced to learn some PHP and to use the basic Magento APIs to do the implementation. This also gave me a better understanding of the challenges a developer has when implementing a design, giving me a better understanding of capabilities and restrictions.

                            <p class="it small center">This is a design challenge I did as part of an interview process with Linkedin</p>

                            <h3>User Research</h3>
                            
                            <p>I spoke with some LinkedIn dormant users (luckily, a lot of my mexican friends are in this category) and found out some of the reasons that make them stop using it:</p>
                                <ul class="list">
                                    <li>Cluttered, too many features </li>
                                    <li>Laziness: it is way too complex to fill out the profile <strong>(Lack of motivation/ lack of interest)</strong>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Wide variety of information</strong>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>On the other hand I asked them about what makes them stay engaged with an app (in this case with a social network) even after they reach their objective, and this is what I found:</p>
                                <ul class="list">
                                    <li><strong>Sense of belonging</strong></li>
                                    <li>Fear of missing something out</li>
                                    <li><strong>See what others are doing / curiosity</strong></li>
                                    <li><strong>See relevant information depending on their profile</strong></li>
                                    <li>Personal or professional growth</li>
                                </ul>

                               <p>In order to gather my findings and thinking, I created the following persona which I’ll be refering to throughout the process to explain my design decisions.</p>

                             <h3>Task Flow</h3>
                             <p>Linkedin gave me the following goals:</p>
                                <ul class="list">
                                    <li>Grow their network</li>
                                    <li>Improve understanding of LinkedIn</li>
                                    <li>Help them accomplish a task that they have come to LinkedIn for</li>
                                </ul>
                            <p>So before skecthing, I needed to figure out the best way for my user to perform the task in order to achieve these goals.
                             I started asking myself: At what point do I consider my users “hooked”?</p>

                             <h3>Scenario</h3>
                                <p>The ideas and wireframes as well as the final design are based on assumptions and a specific scenario:</br>User receives an email informing her that she has an invitation request from one of their colleagues. Since she is at the office, she opens the email in her browser.</p>
                            <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                                <p>I focused on making sure that the user knows, at first glance, something about the person who is adding her.</p>
                                <img src="img/portfolio/linkedin/3wireframes.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                                <p>I tried to make the “welcome back” page the most interesting way possible for the user, so I proposed showing her people that I know she cares about, because they share the same interests (finance in this case). I’m assuming that this little ammount of information is taken from her profile.</p>
                                <p>Even though I let her connect with people, after the system detects that she is a “begginer profile user”, a message appears showing that her profile is lacking of content, “pushing her” to improve so she can look “pro” like the rest of the people in her field.</p>
                            <h3>Visual styles</h3>
                            <p>After some iterations, these are my final design propositions:</p>
                            <p class="it small center">User gets an email notification</p>
